# Our Values

We are a team of experienced engineers, computer scientists and energy trading experts who want to build a more secure, stable and sustainable energy system with cloud-native technologies.

* **Security and availability over everything**. We are controlling power plants, not coffee machines. 
* **Quality built-in**. We believe that clean code and tests are always step one and never step two, because in reality there is never the time 
to tidy up and decrease technical debt. 
* **Teamwork over heroism.** We believe that high-quality software is build by professionally organized teams and not by one man bands.
* **Lightweight technologies over big fat frameworks.** We don't only want to reduce the CO2 footprint, but also the memory footprint.
* **Economical pragmatism over technical perfection.**  We are not a science lab and prefer solutions that are in time and budget, instead of overengineered solutions that can't be paied by customers and never gets finished.
* **Fail fast**. Do or do not, there is not try. If things fail in production, we accept it, but we always have rollback automations in place.
* **Work-life balance over workaholics**. We believe nobody can build a stable power plant if he hasn't a stable private and family live.
